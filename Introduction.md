# A Very Brief Introduction


This project attempts to create a platform in which the general populace can help simplify the data pre-processing process. The average person, henceforth called the `user`, joins the data pre-preprocessing process with the guidance of Robotic Process Automation. The pre-processed data is then sent to entities in need of data (ex. AI developers, data engineers, etc), henceforth called `requester`s.

In comparison to existing players, our item filters data through `RPA` before sending the processed data to users for confirmation. Unlike the manual entering of data required in the present market, robotic process automation ensures that the data is already entered into the system; the user's role is merely check if the data has been input correctly.

Our RPA solution can be divided into four parts: 
1. Image Labelling Automation
2. OCR Labelling Automation
3. Video Labelling Automation
4. Sound Labelling Automation

## A Business Perspective

At the moment, `Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT)` and `Crowdworks` remain the biggest players in the data pre-processing platform market. However, both are considered an unpopular source of data due to low accuracy rates on the part of data requesters, and an unpopular source of work due to inconvenient user interfaces and complicated incentive system on the part of users. In particular, AMT seems to lack an Android userface, forcing users to work in front of a computer screen and encounter a difficult customer experience. Furthermore, both platforms lack exposure to the public due to the lack of attempt to market the product to potential users in the general populace. 

In comparison to existing players, our item filters data through `RPA` before sending the processed data to users for confirmation. Unlike the manual entering of data required in the present market, robotic process automation ensures that the data is already entered into the system; the user's role is merely check if the data has been input correctly.

However, our current strategy is *not* to compete with abovementioned existing players, but to rather collaborate with them by offering our RPA solution to optimise their current platform system. Furthermore, other suggestions we would make would concern increasing interest in their platforms through marketing tactics such as advertisements in mobile games/apps, and simplifying their current payment systems through partnerships with payment platforms such as kakaopay.
